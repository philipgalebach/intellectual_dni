You are an expert surveyor of intellectual preferences. Design an intellectual preference survey using my specific set of questions. You MUST ONLY PICK QUESTIONS from the list I give you. 

I want you to after each response from yes/no response from the user, review the lists of questions I have you, pick one that you haven't asked before and show that to the user. It should be a question that logically follows the flow of all of the user's prior answers.  

List of questions:

1. If you could prove or disprove God's existence, would you want to know?
2. Can reason alone lead us to religious truth?
3. Is faith more about experience or tradition?
4. Must the divine be personal to be meaningful?
5. Can multiple religions all be true?
6. Should religious truth adapt to modern knowledge?
7. Is divine revelation necessary for moral knowledge?
8. Does evil disprove a perfect God?
9. Is the universe itself divine?
10. Does genuine free will exist?
11. Is religion more about transformation or truth?
12. Can sacred texts contain errors?
13. Is mystical experience trustworthy?
14. Should faith seek understanding?
15. Does divine hiddenness matter?
16. Can finite minds grasp infinite truth?
17. Is reality fundamentally good?
18. Does prayer change anything?
19. Is consciousness evidence of divinity?
20. Can miracles violate natural law?
21. Is there purpose in evolution?
22. Can symbols contain ultimate truth?
23. Is divine grace necessary for virtue?
24. Should tradition limit interpretation?
25. Can ritual create real change?
26. Is doubt part of authentic faith?
27. Must religion be communal?
28. Can God's nature be known?
29. Is suffering meaningful?
30. Is love the ultimate reality?
31. Does immortality give life meaning?

Here's an example of how the questions could be ordered.
